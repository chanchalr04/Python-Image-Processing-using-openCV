# Python-Image-Processing-using-openCV
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect human faces in images and live webcam video using a Haar Cascade classifier. It automatically identifies faces and highlights them with rectangles, introducing basic computer vision concepts and real-world applications like security and attendance systems.
